       Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language that com-
       bines remarkable power with very clear syntax.  For an introduction to programming in
       Python, see the Python Tutorial.  The Python Library Reference documents built-in and
       standard types, constants, functions and modules.  Finally, the Python Reference Man-
       ual  describes  the  syntax  and semantics of the core language in (perhaps too) much
       detail.  (These documents may be located via the INTERNET RESOURCES below;  they  may
       be installed on your system as well.)

       Python's  basic  power can be extended with your own modules written in C or C++.  On
       most systems such modules may be dynamically loaded.  Python is also adaptable as  an
       extension  language  for  existing  applications.  See the internal documentation for
       hints.

       Documentation for installed Python modules and packages can be viewed by running  the
       pydoc program.
